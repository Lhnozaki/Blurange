# NoCan.Design

### As a Software Engineer you learn to not repeat your code. In life, you shouldn't have to repeat yourself either.

A Web Application aimed at helping software engineers who have no time, patience, or design skills to create beautiful, ready-to-deploy, personal portfolio websites to showcase their projects and work. The app leverages the clients' data via Github and LinkedIn to create portofolios using one of our pre-made templates.
